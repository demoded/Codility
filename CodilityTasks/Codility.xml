            A non-empty array A consisting of N integers is given. Array A represents numbers on a tape.
            Any integer P, such that 0 &lt; P&lt;N, splits this tape into two non-empty parts: 
            A[0], A[1], ..., A[P − 1] and A[P], A[P + 1], ..., A[N − 1].
            The difference between the two parts is the value of: |(A[0] + A[1] + ... + A[P − 1]) − (A[P] + A[P + 1] + ... + A[N − 1])|
            In other words, it is the absolute difference between the sum of the first part and the sum of the second part.
            <example>
            For example, consider array A such that:
            <code><list type="table">
            <item> A[0] = 3</item>
            <item> A[1] = 1</item>
            <item> A[2] = 2</item>
            <item> A[3] = 4</item>
            <item> A[4] = 3</item>
            </list></code>
            We can split this tape in four places:
            <code><list type="table">
            <item>P = 1, difference = | 3 − 10| = 7</item>
            <item>P = 2, difference = | 4 − 9| = 5</item>
            <item>P = 3, difference = | 6 − 7| = 1</item>
            <item>P = 4, difference = | 10 − 3| = 7</item>
            </list></code>
            the function should return 1, as explained above.
            </example>
            Write a function:
            <code>class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }</code>
            that, given a non-empty array A of N integers, returns the minimal difference that can be achieved.
            Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
            N is an integer within the range[2..100, 000];
            each element of array A is an integer within the range[−1, 000..1, 000].

            An array A consisting of N different integers is given. 
            The array contains integers in the range[1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.
            Your goal is to find that missing element.
            Write a function: that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.
            <example>
            For example, given array A { 2, 3, 1, 5}
            the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.
            </example>

             A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road.
             The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y.
             The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
             Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.
            
             Write a function: that, given three integers X, Y and D, 
             returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.

             An array A consisting of N integers is given.
             Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, 
             and the last element of the array is moved to the first place.
             The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.
